# Syllabus - options and references

I scanned and read a lot of books in preparing for this course. For each section, I've presented a selection of the books that I enjoyed. This is, of course, a very personal list - other instructors will have their own recommendations. Since this is part of a *professional* masters program, the recommended books are generally *non-academic* - meant more for practitioners than professors. 

There are also a *zillion* blog entries and tutorials on every conceivable topic in data science - I generally recommend reading a book to get a good perspective on a topic, and only then supplementing with shorter web resources to get another explanation of a tricky concept, reference the official documentation for a package, or to find out about the latest shiny toy. Relying only on the web will likely lead to a unsatisfying patchwork of random bits of knowledge.

The syllabus is a little idiosyncratic - I generally cover about 80% of the material with some depth, and for the remaining 20%, all you get is a suggestion that *this is a cool topic, and if you are interested, here is a good place to start*. *Which* 80% is covered varies from year to year - probably due to quantum fluctuations, or perhaps, ancient Mayan prophecies.
