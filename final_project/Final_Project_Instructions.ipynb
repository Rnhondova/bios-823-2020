    "For the final project, you will choose a data set(s) from the following topics\n",
    "\n",
    "- COVID-19\n",
    "- ICU admission\n",
    "- Brain imaging\n",
    "\n",
    "From a team of 3-4 people. Each team will need to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify and frame data science problem to solve given the data (data analyst/domain expert)\n",
    "- Process and manage the data so that it is easily accessible (data engineer)\n",
    "- Develop the analysis, modeling and reporting data product (data scientist / machine learning engineer)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each group member will also have to do the following *individual* task:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a post on GitHub-pages about the project and what you learned from doing this\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: 80% of the grade will be based on the quality of the project as a whole (team effort); 20% will be based on teh quality of the blog/report (individual effort).\n",
    "\n",
    "### You should use the project to showcase the following skill sets\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic skills\n",
    "    - Effective use of version control\n",
    "        - Ideally, showcase branch and merge skills for concurrent feature development / bug fixes\n",
    "    - Literate programming\n",
    "    - Functional coding style\n",
    "- Domain knowledge\n",
    "    - Introduction of domain concepts necessary to understand the data set(s)\n",
    "    - Framing the data science challenge\n",
    "- Data management\n",
    "    - Use of different data formats\n",
    "    - Use of SQL and/or NoSQL databases\n",
    "- Data analysis and visualization\n",
    "    - Data cleaning and validation\n",
    "    - Use of linked data sources if applicable\n",
    "    - Attractive and easy-to-understand reports and/or dashboards\n",
    "- Development of data product\n",
    "    - This is often a predictive machine learning model (classical or deep)\n",
    "        - Construct pipeline, perform model training, evaluation and selection\n",
    "    - Other data products can also be developed (in place of or in addition to supervised learning) if more appropriate for your problem\n",
    "        - Examples - unsupervised or self-supervised models, graphical models, complex interactive visualizations\n",
    "- Operationalization\n",
    "    - Testing, logging, monitoring, streaming, packaging if applicable\n",
    "    - Use of distributed computing platform if applicable\n",
    "    - Deployment to cloud platform (including serverless if applicable)\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Milestones\n",
    "\n",
    "- Form team (diversity is essential - teams **must** consist of people from at least 2 different programs)\n",
    "- Initial exploration of data sets for all topics\n",
    "- Choose topic\n",
    "- Further exploration of data sets for selected topic\n",
    "- Frame data science problem to solve\n",
    "- Develop the data science and machine learning product\n",
    "- Deploy the product to a cloud platform (GCP, Azure, AWS)\n",
    "- Streamline and automate \n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggestions for working as a team\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should begin as soon as possible\n",
    "- Aim to have a group meeting at least 1-2 times a week\n",
    "- Set up Teams or Slack for communication within your team\n",
    "- Probably easiest if someone takes the role of project manager to \n",
    "    - coordinate group activities \n",
    "    - check that sufficient progress is being made week-by-week.\n",
    "- Avoid excessive \"divide and conquer\" specialization\n",
    "    - individual should take on at least two roles\n",
    "    - each skill set area should have at least two people involved\n",
    "    - teach your team members how you performed a task that not everyone is familiar with\n",

    "- To access the data set, you may need to register on the site, or even complete specified training courses.\n",
    "- If you need the data sets put on the Duke Spark cluster, please let me know and we will work with OIT to make this possible\n",
